### Project 1 - Previsao de Vendas - Sales Predict
 **Goal:** The goal of this project is to predict the Sales of a company by their advertising investment using Machine Learning.  

 **Description:** In this project I've made a comparrison with Linear Regression and Decision Tree models.  

 **Results:** The Decision Tree proved a R2 higher and have returned that the TV advertisement investment have more impact in the Sales revenue.  
 Also, we've checked that the company is spending more money with a form of advertising that is not so efficient (*'Jornal'* compared with *'Radio'*).  
 
### Project 2 - Binance bot

**Goal:** The main goal of this project is to build a bot that can send orders to Binance based on preset strategies.

**Description:** This robot currently has the ability to compare the price paid in Bitcoin, and compare it every two hours with the current price. After the comparison, the robot sends a message to the user informing the current Bitcoin price and if the user is making a profit.
In the future, this price comparison module will be absorbed by the main objective of the project - the execution of orders based on predefined strategies.

**Results:** So far, a module for comparing prices and sending results via Telegram has been built.
The robot also has the ability to access the asset price via the Binance API and the Dollar quote via the awesomeapi API.
